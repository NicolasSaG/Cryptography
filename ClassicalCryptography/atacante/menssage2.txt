The terror, which would not end for another t0enty-eight years#~"if it ever did end#~"began, so far as I know or can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspaperxfloating down axgutter swollen with rain. The boat bobbed, listed, righted itself again, dived bravely through treacherous whirlpools, and continued on its wayxdown Witcham Street toward the traffic light which marked the intersection of Witcham and Jackson. The three vertical lenses onxall sides of the traffic light were dark this afternoon in the fall of 1957, and the houses were all dark, too.xThere had been steady rain for a week now, and two days ago thexwinds had come as well. Most sections of Derry had lost their power then, and it was not back on yet. A small boy in a yellow slicker and red galoshes ran cheerfully along beside the newspaper boat. The rainxhad not stopped, but it was finally slackening.xIt tapped on the yellow hood ofxthe boy#~@s slicker, sounding to his ears like rain on a shed roof ... a comfortable, almost cozy sound. The bo. in the yellow slicker 0as George Denbrough. Hexwas six. His brother, William, known to most ofxthe kids at Derry Elementary School (and even to the teachers, who would never have used the nickname to his face) as Stuttering Bill, 0as at home, hacking outxthe last of a nasty case of influenza. In that autumn of 19_7, eight months before the real horrors began and twenty-eight years before the final showdown, Stuttering Bill wasxten years old+ About three-quarters of the way down the block as one headed toward the intersection and the dead traffic light,xWitcham Street was blocked to motor traffic by smudgepots and four orange sawhorses. Stencilledxacross each of the horses was DEREY DEPT. OF PUBLIC WORKS. Beyond them, the rain had spilled out of gutters clogged with branches and rocks andxbig sticky piles of autumn leaves. The 0ater had first pried fingerholds in thexpaving and thenxsnatched whole greedy handfuls&~"all of this byxthe third day of the rains. By noon of the fourth day, big chunks of the street#^@s surface were boating through the intersection of Jackson and Witcham like miniature white-water rafts. By that time, many people in Derry had begun to makexnervous jokes about arks. The Public Works Department had managed to keep Jackson Street open, but Witcham was impassable from the sawhorses all the way to thexcenter of town.xBut everyone agreed, the worst was over. The Kenduskeag Stream had crested justxbelow its banksxin the Barrens and bare inches below the concrete sides of the Canal which channelled it tightl. as it passed through downtown.xRight now a gang of men#~"Zack Denbrough, George#~@s and Bill#~@s father, amongxthem#'6^TwR)mcj5eN,pc*WxzxNyYZXwbp[q&:z1Pix5cpl,Wp]yc*WxziN06ZbvXW4]O#i1zxhnc9mqWN2tQLWthyR{6Wb9cJ"m}:z8kjeqgmt-JS3]&@excxV7Z9c2XT3]|7btVjxsVb89NJ.n|LP5btf56gkueN[j+_T:zLbo6ikufp83c-PwzmN1kckuMp1n^(gx4(45cc8vUT-mA]V@Xsx.41x-QF3]+ T7zfxodqX9cJ"]O-XvW~UlY9Z5bYEvA_a2dsf)jd8tXQ jJ+ztcixlgkl9cp[6GLS8oja)ggsubqEc:7i@lff)V9i5WLE3A[T@Plb}6Zr0tY7nJ z^TwR)nrf2Up4wG|V1zuRzkjb-JW-4F0z^Wtx3Zkb3KJ"n|LX,zyb)naX8Np[q&Lgxhyy)Jlb-XKE3: zyatbo6tfscN.2c-PwzgRpi9c5dS3]L^T7i41qdtb-VN nKLTthyz)dl8RdH02H(g,1~GsZ9cybMEq}0zxPyRy6reybp]w^(g,jsN5Z9duWY nE7cC5Df)Zwb9vp[qJ T@dkxsdq8vRS6nJ+2@Wnf)kckybrEjF0z6dxg)jd8xRXEu&.i@Utb579:2dY2q&0z2c~jsVr88NRzrF S@dkxsdq8xJS32c-PwzgRpi9X-]T"mc+ixTwVyb9txNJ (ctd^2~gsjsdxvp[q&Lg2kje)rYp-aJ2n|#cz2~NyY9txNSE3: z7T2xMVld5apg8|}d@SfZ)rck0tN,]M)h,gjNx89qxNp"rN g@lthwY9ZuJX4]L(zuT~N)ofouJYS].}z.d~fldb8pJH0]1 cugthrc 8,QTE6G}ZxS~Szm9@qWL-1cnnwgtRwZaq8RHS]x+zydwx5cc88NX[ hElxaqz)asq aJEoD(dwh~Pzpja-cF0nc9P T~bq6reuVX4uN h:zYUp6reyWLE6}+z,d~Tpo9qxaT]p:Li1Xxxzic0-cTEp&*z,Wjx1jub8tGzlCLd72~NyY9qxNSE3GLU8glR56gq&t[,]1 g n~f6Xf8vXW6nL*X7V~bq6roqPJ38c7cwziV4Vqquap)jKLP5btf56Yk-JW[)c7h@)nYw6Bb4KW-4@-z^dzYo6al3Np[xc0X.Rtipm9f4tY7nc9d-gxR)jd80RR4(cmT8glR)kYr9NIEsM+i@Qjlzib80QJE2}^W8gxR46Yq-cM4]&0VxztS)V9auNUE1}&X7T~gsVr8xJIEk& c@Rzg)ofo5dL7]L-T@ife)nsovJH4]G.zpXyPsVk8icW4nLMzmWnf)mYsyWJE1}]z8c~Ny6Yi3XX[]&@Pvi~QtVel4JQS]6*zxciRo6mk-cM4]^7g@hnQp6mc-cM4]K*gxTyz)mmrwQQ}]^(g,n~SpZr8vJW[q&}zwd2a)ofb-QN uc.g8b~jsZpb-QJEwG^z.itbo89l4tY7nc}XzWyy)Cc82JZ6q&0ztatho0--0QJE2G|cwztS)nmiycF"8eLR1XqQtnf8wUJ4]}LQ XlU56pr4WJ"]A]z,Wfg)bpX&tF53&}c8ds2'{Tn ZYz9HY,7[iX9zaZ e:s:Jl2[5Ulcx4o2n@#~JqAxijWp"UjnsYm)UmAi[mUYrX9zn{i]lpvxqXk93adpgYl9E9wmmh3dukhrcYfBlr3m[Vjcgd6vmYx~F9#iz63RnX68q*i)U9_i2Yj9nTY bIxNB9xpihfcr4ruh)lNSY9[ifglm4oudYh"Be0vif59ggY rC#~JqAjwUl9zkV9d:p,E91zwg3mtX66h{iNPdAeqnUfgf6fsFi,U9#w[nZc"houdF"NUfz[kojpkgo b]v*Zg9o[cl9yh6sZGxNUfv2[AWmxZZ g]hNUmA1xlalz4o20@i,Q9~x[qarn4d7 Ya9Uc,[1jjY5XY nIxNGp0u[VWlkTou0|m|levtwmZcy4d10Ay.EwA1pYWry_6gg}m*lZ~ksfWq"fVqdYeNKm7t75bgtZgvm*#9T9bmwlYc"&Z1aFs^HfAzih3rupV5cYl"T9-2zUfek4YrZHlOl@9l[nZc"YZrk&r#lu3qkb3doegrcYl"N9v2[nZYz4h2l}r&luv1[Wdcgk6nm{#|Jk tm5dm2X6snF#~JqAjzilfkk6Oh:pNm0B[tinc"Tiq0]#&Psxp[iX9xXb5dH#&IY#[Jcdj"Vj8k{rEq&#[jY3fkkZ sC#|FcA2pck9ggY a}#9lnvz25gd"bo+08jNDm~z1Y3fk4r2t:hNUp][2i3bklX5h(iNJrA2w5+gre60g}rNIcAown3fufZ*0(y&lfz[shWu"aZ vCy]ElE}Gn3Zk4Vok}#&P98isY3:oeg r}iNJrC[2bW93Tt A&p]lu03tX3fgoZ a}i)lYwtm5lm"fVxdYl"N9-mm5ar"ba s|i"S9 w1clgugn g]hNCczv[lWtkknrcZ#jJj7[5Uk9mhjq0]xNScvlqhY9ggY vFm&Jl2([Vmr"XqrmYe&lf41[UYc":Z2q*iNXY-[5ckc"Xi2t*lNUmAsvio9zaV70Ke|O,SG25lfk4j1kM#*FY-wv5of54&vk:##PrAitf3@(9+60CrNIg-[zYhmxm6pZFh|n90z[qZw"ad60Hi9Dfzz15dgqXY g&wNDm8xwmarohi60GsNXc7t]5Lcred1fY19T90vts3ngko n+#"U0AJqfd93Tn fCs.lY#[1YWgtZ7
